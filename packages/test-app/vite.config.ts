/**
 * Vite config for the browser smoke test of @polygonlabs/pos-sdk.
 *
 * # Why no Buffer / process polyfill plugins
 *
 * The whole point of this package is to catch SDK code paths that
 * accidentally rely on Node built-ins. If we silently install
 * `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` (or `define: { 'global.Buffer': ... }`)
 * the browser bundle would mask exactly the failure mode we are trying
 * to surface. A consumer who installs the SDK into their Vite app and
 * does NOT also install a Buffer polyfill plugin is the realistic
 * deployment surface — that is the configuration we mirror here.
 *
 * # Why we consume the published `dist/` shape
 *
 * The pos-sdk package.json exposes only the built `dist/` outputs
 * through `exports`. This app deliberately consumes the same artefacts
 * a published-npm consumer would: the tsup ESM bundle. That keeps the
 * smoke-test faithful to what users actually receive.
