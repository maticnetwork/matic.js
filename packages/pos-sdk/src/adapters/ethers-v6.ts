 * has chosen ethers v6 — and therefore installed it — ever imports this
 * file, so the top-level `import { Contract, Interface } from 'ethers'`
 * always resolves. The main SDK entry imports NO web3 library, so a
 * viem-only consumer never pulls ethers in. Imports use `'ethers'`
 * directly because the bare `ethers` at this monorepo level is v6 (the
 * `ethers-v5` alias only exists for the v5 adapter). This replaces the
