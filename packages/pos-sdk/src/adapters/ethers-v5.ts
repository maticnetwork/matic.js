 *
 * # bigint ↔ BigNumber conversion
 *
 * ethers v5 returns `BigNumber` for every numeric value (gas, balances,
 * receipt block numbers via `.toNumber()` semantics, etc.). Our
 * Adapter contract speaks native `bigint`. Conversion happens at this
 * layer:
 *
 * - **Inputs (`bigint` → `BigNumber`):** v5's `BigNumberish` already
 *   accepts `bigint`, so values pass through `BigNumber.from()` only
 *   when the v5 API explicitly requires it. The `Contract` instance
 *   handles BigNumberish coercion for us in the common case; explicit
 *   `BigNumber.from(...)` calls remain for documentation purposes
 *   wherever the boundary is non-obvious.
 * - **Outputs (`BigNumber` → `bigint`):** every numeric return is
 *   piped through `.toBigInt()` before leaving the adapter. v5 has
 *   exposed `toBigInt()` since 5.6.0 so the peer-dep range
 *   `^5.5.1 || ^6.0.0` is updated to `^5.6.0 || ^6.0.0` in stage 8.
 *
 * # Why a static value-import is safe here
 *
 * `ethers` is an OPTIONAL peer dep, but this module lives behind its own
 * package subpath (`@polygonlabs/pos-sdk/ethers-v5`). Only a consumer who
 * has chosen ethers v5 — and therefore installed it — ever imports this
 * file, so a top-level value-import always resolves. The main SDK entry
 * imports NO web3 library, so a viem-only consumer never pulls ethers in.
 *
 * The source imports `Contract` / `utils` from the `ethers-v5` devDep
 * alias (a pinned `npm:ethers@5`) so the compiler sees the genuine v5
 * surface. The tsup build rewrites that specifier to the bare `ethers`
 * the consumer actually installs (see `tsup.config.ts`). This replaces
 * the old dynamic `await import('ethers')` that existed only to keep the
 * combined adapter barrel evaluable when ethers was absent.
 */
