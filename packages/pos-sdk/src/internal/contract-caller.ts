/**
 * `ContractCaller` is the read/write/estimate front-door for every
 * contract the SDK touches.
 *
 * # Why this service exists
 *
 * The legacy SDK extended a four-deep inheritance chain
 * (`BaseToken → POSToken → ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155`) where the base
 * class owned all the transaction plumbing — fee-cap validation, gas
 * estimation, chain-id lookups, payload assembly. Every concrete
 * token class inherited that surface, which forced *all* code that
 * touched contracts to live somewhere in that hierarchy. Stage 2
 * dismantles the chain in favour of composition: each token class
 * (`ERC20`, `ERC721`, …) holds a `private caller: ContractCaller`
 * and forwards through it.
 *
 * # Design notes
 *
 * - `getAddress` is a callback rather than a static field so
 *   infrastructure contracts route through `AddressFetcher.get()` and
 *   pick up TTL refreshes when the published address index changes.
 *   For user-supplied token addresses the consumer passes
 *   `() => Promise.resolve(addr)` and pays no per-call cost.
 * - Every public method awaits `getAddress()` first. The address is
 *   not cached on the caller instance — caching belongs in the
 *   underlying `AddressFetcher`, which already implements
 *   stale-while-revalidate.
 * - The gas multiplier (`1.15` by default) preserves the legacy
 *   behaviour from `base_token.ts:190`. It accepts an optional
 *   override so future stages can tune per-network.
 * - `chainId` is cached on the caller for the lifetime of the
 *   instance — re-reading it on every write would add an RPC round-
 *   trip with no benefit (chain IDs do not change at runtime).
